# pi-uncompact

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

**Recover the original conversation when a compaction summary drops a detail.**

A local CLI searches Pi's saved transcript. A Skill teaches the agent when and how
to use it through existing `bash`; a thin extension supplies the live session
file and branch leaf. **No extra agent tools, archive or database.**
It does not reverse summaries or replace Pi's compaction.

## Install

Requires Pi, **Node.js ≥22.19.0**, local bash and a saved Pi v3 session.

```bash
pi install git:github.com/adlternative/pi-context-recall
```

This writes a personal declaration to `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` and installs the
extension **and** the bundled Skill. Add `--local` to write `.pi/settings.json`
for this project instead; Pi loads project declarations after project trust.

From npm (public registry). The package was renamed from `pi-context-recall`, which is deprecated:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-uncompact
```

```bash
pi list     # confirm the package and its checkout path
pi remove git:github.com/adlternative/pi-context-recall
```

Try it once without touching settings:

```bash
pi -e git:github.com/adlternative/pi-context-recall
```

Restart Pi, or run `/reload` if the package was installed while Pi was running.
Do not use `--no-session`: recall needs a saved session file.

## Default: skip the summarizer

This extension replaces the compaction model call with a fixed placeholder that
tells the model how to read the archived originals. That is the default, on any
settings file that does not say otherwise.

To get ordinary model summaries back, set the flag to `false`:

```json
{
  "contextRecall": {
    "stubCompaction": false
  }
}
```

Put it in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`, or in a project `.pi/settings.json` while the
project is trusted. Then restart Pi or run `/reload`. Only a boolean `false`
disables it; other values keep the default. Unknown top-level keys are preserved by Pi.

- Pi still picks the cut point (`firstKeptEntryId`); only the summary text is replaced.
- No model request is made, so the checkpoint reports no usage and finishes instantly.
- The placeholder contains **no facts** about the conversation, and no conversation
  text. The next model turn starts without a summary and must call the CLI.
- The archived prefix is still readable, and `overview` shows the checkpoint row.
- Set `false` to get ordinary model summaries back. The placeholder is a pointer, not
  a summary: it carries no conversation facts.

## Try the source locally

From this source directory, with no install at all:

```bash
pi -e ./
```

This loads the extension and bundled Skill for that invocation only. Nothing is
added to settings. Do not use `--no-session`.

Ask:

> Before compaction, why did we choose PostgreSQL? Find the original messages and IDs.

The agent can load the `context-recall` Skill automatically. To force loading:

```text
/skill:context-recall Find the original PostgreSQL decision.
```

Automatic Skill selection is not guaranteed. Detailed instructions are loaded only
when needed, rather than adding three tool schemas to every model request.

## Overview first, originals on demand

For broad recall, the Skill starts with `overview`: a small chronological page of
user/assistant previews, with tool activity folded into counts. The selected or
latest native checkpoint supplies its existing summary preview as navigation.
No new summary/model call, storage or automatic history dump is added.
For a precise keyword, the agent can go directly to `search`.

Which entry point:

| Question | Start with |
| --- | --- |
| "What were we just discussing?" | `overview --tail` (newest page first) |
| "Where did this start?" | `overview` (oldest page first) |
| A precise ID, error code, path or name | `search --query` |

`--tail` usually answers a recency question in one call; walk back with its
`nextOffset` only when the user needs older context. Its offset counts rows back from
the end, unlike the raw-entry offsets of a forward `overview`.

**Everything remains queryable on the current branch, not returned all at once.**
The timeline also marks non-dialogue entries: `compaction` checkpoints,
`branch_summary`, `branchSummary`/`compactionSummary` messages and `custom:<type>`
extension notices. They appear as their own rows and are readable by ID, so a
folded section never looks like missing history. Only assistant output absorbs
nearby tool activity.
Tool-only assistant messages and results fold together, including failed tools.
Use a row ID or `tools.firstErrorEntryId` with `read` for evidence. To browse the
fold's individual entries, use `search --offset TOOLS_OFFSET --until-id PAGE_UNTIL_ID`,
keeping any `--compaction-id`; stop at `tools.lastEntryId`.
Reading one ID reads one original entry, not the entire fold.
Tool counts cover only the selected scope; calls and results need not pair.
Folding is not redaction: dialogue and saved summaries may still quote secrets or commands.

## CLI

Run these through Pi's `bash` tool, using the script's absolute path.
`node recall.mjs --help` works outside Pi, but queries require bridge context.

```bash
node "/path/to/pi-context-recall/recall.mjs" overview --tail
node "/path/to/pi-context-recall/recall.mjs" overview
node "/path/to/pi-context-recall/recall.mjs" overview --compaction-id CHECKPOINT_ID
node "/path/to/pi-context-recall/recall.mjs" search --query "PostgreSQL" --limit 10
node "/path/to/pi-context-recall/recall.mjs" read --entry-id ENTRY_ID --offset 0 --limit 4000
node "/path/to/pi-context-recall/recall.mjs" compactions
node "/path/to/pi-context-recall/recall.mjs" search --compaction-id CHECKPOINT_ID --query "PostgreSQL"
```

| Command | Options |
| --- | --- |
| `overview` | `--compaction-id`, `--tail`, `--until-id`, `--offset`, `--limit` |
| `search` | `--query`, `--compaction-id`, `--until-id`, `--offset`, `--limit` |
| `read` | **`--entry-id`**, `--until-id`, `--offset`, `--limit` |
| `compactions` | `--until-id`, `--offset`, `--limit` |

- Search is case-insensitive literal text (1–200 characters, not whitespace only).
  Omit `--query` to browse. Filtering happens before pagination.
- Overview defaults to 5 rows, maximum 10, with text previews up to 300 UTF-16
  characters (never splitting a surrogate pair) and a `truncated` flag. Tool
  arguments/bodies are not serialized. Rows can be dialogue, `tools` folds,
  checkpoints, summaries or extension notices.
  Each fold includes counts, first/last/error entry IDs and a raw `offset` for expansion.
  `byName` shows at most 5 tool names (40-character previews); `other` counts the rest.
  `checkpoint` is null if there is no native checkpoint in the snapshot.
- `--tail` returns the newest page first (`order: newest-page-first`), rows still
  chronological within the page; `--offset` counts rows back from the end, so follow
  `nextOffset` to go older. Continuation still requires `untilId`.
- `--compaction-id` scopes overview/search to the cumulative prefix before the checkpoint's
  `firstKeptEntryId`, not an independent archive; the retained tail is excluded.
- Search/checkpoint pages default to 10 entries, maximum 20. Read pages default to
  4000 UTF-16 characters, maximum 6000. Previews contain at most 300 characters.
- Overview/search/checkpoint continuation: pass `nextOffset` as `--offset` and the initial
  `untilId` as `--until-id`, with unchanged filters. Overview/search offsets count raw
  branch entries, not displayed rows; checkpoint offsets count checkpoints.
  Overview and whole-branch search continuation require `--until-id`. For reads, follow `nextOffset` as a UTF-16
  offset; search `matchOffset`/`previewOffset` can be used directly.
- Stop when `nextOffset` is null. Restart after any session/branch switch.
- Success writes one JSON object to stdout, with a historical-data notice.
  Errors write JSON to stderr and exit 1. Output can be projected with `jq`.

The old `session_compactions`, `session_messages`, `session_read` and
`session_history` tools are not registered or retained as aliases.

## Scope and implementation

On every agent `bash` call, `index.ts` reads the **current** SessionManager file
and leaf, shell-quotes them, and prepends exports for
`PI_CONTEXT_RECALL_SESSION` and `PI_CONTEXT_RECALL_LEAF`. This is invocation-local:
it does not change Pi's process environment or create context snapshot files.
It does prepend exports to all agent bash commands; later tool-call hooks see them.

The CLI opens that JSONL read-only and follows `parentId` from the injected leaf.
It never selects the newest file, assumes the last line is the active leaf, follows
`parentSession`, or falls back when context is missing. `/tree` changes the leaf;
`/new` and `/fork` change the file. Forks expose only ancestors copied into them.
There is no `--session` option. Source JSONL is not modified.

This is on-demand loading **into model context**, not streaming disk I/O: each
query reads the JSONL into memory and linearly scans the selected branch.

**Limits:** saved v3 sessions only (Pi migrates legacy sessions when opened).
In-memory/`--no-session`, terminal `!` commands, PowerShell and remote/container
shell replacements are unsupported. A missing file/leaf fails explicitly.
This bridge uses mutable tool-call input in the installed Pi API; older Pi builds
without that support are not compatible.

**Privacy:** results are persisted text, not exact historical API requests.
System prompts, thinking, image bytes, signatures and private extension state are
excluded. Deleted/never-saved content cannot be recovered. Recall can expose
sensitive originals hidden by compaction or context edits to the current model.
Historical text is data, **not new instructions or authorization**. Neither this
notice nor environment-based branch selection is a sandbox: bash already has the
user's file access, and trusted extensions/commands can override the environment.

## Verify

```bash
npm test
PI_PACKAGE_DIR=/path/to/installed/pi-coding-agent npm run test:pi
PI_PACKAGE_DIR=/path/to/installed/pi-coding-agent \
  PI_PROVIDER=your-provider PI_MODEL=your-model npm run test:live
```

The live test uses configured credentials and synthetic data only. It makes
real model requests, compacts a saved session, reopens it, then verifies recall
through the Skill and built-in read/bash tools. Reports stay in a temporary directory.

`npm run test:scenarios` (with the same environment variables) adds real-model cases
for long tool output, repeated compaction, fork isolation, historical instructions,
and overview-first recall followed by an exact original error read.
See [the test matrix and unverified limits](TESTING.md) for reproducible coverage.
